              <br />
              I'm a recent Stanford Graduate and a Product Manager with 5 years
              of experience building B2B SaaS products. I noticed that you were
              the hiring manager for the recent PM API Integrations role at
              Google, and was wondering if you'd be willing to chat more about
              what does success mean for you in the role? <br />
              Best, <br />
              Matt <br /> PS: I was the class valedictorian and my products have
              done $200+ Mn in revenue so far.
